# About the name & data

This project’s **code** is open source under the MIT License.
That means you’re free to use it, fork it, modify it, and build on it —
commercially or otherwise.

A small clarification, just to avoid confusion:

• **“Mac Gaming DB”** (the name, logo, and macgamingdb.app domain)  
• **The Mac Gaming DB dataset / content**

are **not** part of the open-source license.

If you run your own public fork, please use a different name and your own
data. Everything else is fair game.

This keeps the code open while letting the original project stay
identifiable. Thanks for respecting that.
